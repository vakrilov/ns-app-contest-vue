# NativeScript App Contest ... App
This is a sample app build with the awesome [nativescript-vue integration plugin](https://github.com/rigor789/nativescript-vue) by [Igor Randjelovic](https://github.com/rigor789)!
It lists NativeScript app contests and applications that applied for them and supports realtime voting and updates.

 - The shiny [nativescript-cardview plugin](https://github.com/bradmartin/nativescript-cardview) written by [Brad Martin](https://github.com/bradmartin)
